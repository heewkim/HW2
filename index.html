	Hi, my name is Heewon Kim from South Korea. I born in 1992. I grow up in Seoul, the capital city of South Korea.
	I¡¯m 24 years old senior in the University of Iowa, major in Finance and Information System. 
	My hometown is Jamsil where to locate southeast part of the Seoul. 
	Jamsil is known for the big amusement park called ¡°Lotte World¡± and Lotte World Tower that is 123th floor high. 
	In 2008, I applied for the student exchange program in U.S. It was my first-time study abroad.
	I got lucky chance to stay in Minnesota,the Midwest State where so many lakes, corn, and snow exist.
	In MN, I met Brouwer family who take care of me with love. I went to MACCRAY public high school and graduated in 2010.
	(memorable year when the Vikings went to NFC championship game with Brett Favre.I am a huge Minnesota Vikings fan!) 
	After I graduate from high school, I had many choice but I became a Hawkeye becuase I love Iowa Hawkeye's football.
	After my sophomore year in Iowa, I had to go back to Korea for the military obligation.
	In 2012 summer, I joined the Air Force of the Republic of Korea and served two years.
	My duty was to manage the meeting center for the chief commander of the Air Force.
	With the termination of my service I came back to Iowa and joined Tippie College of Business to study BAIS and Finance.
