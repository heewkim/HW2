	In 2008, I applied for the student exchange program in U.S. It was my first-time study abroad.
	I got lucky chance to stay in Minnesota,the Midwest State where so many lakes, corn, and snow exist.
	In MN, I met Brouwer family who take care of me with love. I went to MACCRAY public high school and graduated in 2010.

	After I graduate from high school, I had to choose college. I became a Hawkeye becuase I love Iowa Hawkeye's football.
	After my sophomore year in Iowa, I had to go back to Korea for the military obligation.
	In 2012 summer, I joined the Air Force of the Republic of Korea and served two years.
	My duty was to manage the meeting center for the chief commander of the Air Force.
